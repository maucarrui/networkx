"""
An algorithm for finding if two undirected trees are isomorphic, and if so 
returns an isomorphism between the two sets of nodes.

This algorithm uses a routine to tell if two rooted trees (trees with a
specified root node) are isomorphic, which may be independently useful.

def tree_isomorphism(t1, t2):
    """
    Given two undirected (or free) trees `t1` and `t2`,
    this routine will determine if they are isomorphic.
    It returns the isomorphism, a mapping of the nodes of `t1` onto the nodes
    of `t2`, such that two trees are then identical.

    Note that two trees may have more than one isomorphism, and this
    routine just returns one valid mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t1 : undirected NetworkX graph
        One of the trees being compared

    t2 : undirected NetworkX graph
        The other tree being compared

    Returns
    -------
    isomorphism : list
        A list of pairs in which the left element is a node in `t1`
        and the right element is a node in `t2`.  The pairs are in
        arbitrary order.  If the nodes in one tree is mapped to the names in
        the other, then trees will be identical. Note that an isomorphism
        will not necessarily be unique.

        If `t1` and `t2` are not isomorphic, then it returns the empty list.

    Notes
    -----
    This runs in O(n*log(n)) time for trees with n nodes.
